# Forum app enterprise and application rules

## A Node app for users to interact in a Q&A format, build on Domain Driven Design concepts

The idea behind the project is for users to interact with each other, with the possibility to 
send attachments to their questions to enrich experience.

It's also a part of my personal portfolio, which I use to explore DDD, Clean Architecture principles,
some patterns like: Aggregation and Watched List

This is the first of two parts of the project, being this first part only to build the enterprise and application business
rules, without concerning about the interface and frameworks, so that this part of the project can be reused for whatever
similar forum apps will be built. For the final result access: [nest-clean](https://github.com/ArthurPMachado/nest-clean)
